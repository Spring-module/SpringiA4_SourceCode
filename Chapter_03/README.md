Chapter 3 Examples
==================
This folder contains example code for chapter 3 of Spring in Action, 4th Edition.
The samples are split across multiple directories:

 * ch3_profiles     : Examples illustrating profile configuration for section 3.1.
 * ch3_conditionals : Examples illustrating conditional configuration for section 3.2.
 * ch3_scopedbeans  : Examples illustrating scoped bean configuration for section 3.4.
 * ch3_externals    : Examples illustrating external configuration for section 3.5.

Note that because the examples evolve throughout the chapter and the book's text sometimes
shows multiple ways of accomplishing a goal, not all variations of the code in the book will
be represented in these samples. You are invited to use this source code as a starting point
and experiment using the variations presented in the text.
